# 19 Progressive Web Applications (PWA): Text Editor

## Your Task

Build a text editor that runs in the browser. The app will be a single-page application that meets the PWA criteria. Additionally, it will feature a number of data persistence techniques that serve as redundancy in case one of the options is not supported by the browser. The application will also function offline.

## Description

This is a progressive web application that works in both online and offline browsers. Through the use of an integrated service worker and Cache APIs, the application can also be used in a standalone environment and continue to function properly. The objective was to demonstrate a platform that would allow users to take notes or create code snippets without a working internet connection.
